Everything WSLC AI Agent does, first at a glance, then area by area.

## At a glance

- **An MCP agent for WSLC, skill included for Claude, Hermes, OpenClaw, etc.**
  - 53 MCP tools: your AI assistant runs your containers, and asks your approval before anything destructive
  - Its skill, which teaches the assistant WSLC, installed with one click into Claude Code, Hermes Agent or OpenClaw
  - A small Windows program that sits next to `wslc`, Microsoft's container CLI, and runs it for you
  - Runs in the background of your Windows session: close the browser and the apps, and its jobs, restart policies, alarms and notifications go on
  - Serves everything itself: the web interface, the native clients, a REST API (`/api/v1`) and an MCP server
  - Installed per user, with no administrator rights; an icon beside the clock
- **Easy container management with WSLC**, all of it from one place
  - Containers, images, volumes, networks and sessions, as lists or cards
  - Run, create, edit, recreate, start, stop, restart, kill, remove, back up, export
  - Paste a `docker run` or `wslc run` line and get the form filled in, checked before it runs
  - Pull, build, tag, push, save, import and load images; create and prune everything
  - Live stats, a live network map, per-session disk usage and VHDX compaction
  - Restart policies enforced by the agent itself
- **Manage from anywhere**: not only the WSLC machine, its containers too
  - Reach the agent from a phone, another PC or the internet: login or API token, SSH tunnels to a VPS
  - Consoles: the host's terminal and a shell in any container, in the browser
  - Open a container's web page even when it is not published, through a browser streamed from the agent's machine
  - Publish a container's port on a public HTTPS name through a built-in nginx proxy
- **A file browser inside containers, images and volumes**, with transfers that keep running when you leave
- **Logs**: the agent's own log and every `wslc` command it ran, filterable, live
- **A dashboard you design yourself**
  - Drag, resize and group live objects on a grid: readings, dials, charts, logs, containers, images, volumes, networks
  - Two pages (System and User), each with a landscape and a portrait layout that follows the screen
  - Kept on the server for every client, or on each device, and copied between them
  - Drafts that survive a power cut; Save and Discard
  - Alarms with thresholds that turn a card red and appear in a status bar on every screen
  - Zoom and five ways to fit any screen: Fit, Fill, Width, Stretch, Fluid
- **Notifications** on Windows and Android: thresholds, stopped containers, sessions down, jobs done, updates
- **Every client, one UI**: web browser (also as an installable PWA), Windows app, Android app, and a tray icon
- **Multi-client and multi-agent**: several clients on one agent share jobs and state; one client knows several agents
- **Self-updating**: the agent and its clients update from one folder, with a countdown anyone can cancel
- **Personalisable**: dark and light themes, page zoom, table or cards per list, and the look of every control

## The MCP agent

WSLC AI Agent is one Windows program, `wslc-ai-agent.exe`, that runs beside
`wslc` in your user session and does the work: every screen, client and
AI assistant asks the agent, and the agent runs `wslc`. It is an MCP server
from the start, with its skill included for Claude, Hermes, OpenClaw, etc.

### MCP and AI assistants

- **An MCP server** in the agent (`/api/v1/mcp`) with 53 tools: containers,
  images, volumes, networks, sessions, publishing, notifications, logs and
  the machine's state, and the paste of a `docker run` line.
- **Destructive tools ask first**: a yes or no in the assistant where it
  supports it, a confirmation step otherwise. They can be hidden entirely.
- **A skill** that teaches the assistant how to work with WSLC, served by the
  agent itself and **installed with one click** into Claude Code, Hermes Agent
  or OpenClaw, on this machine or another over SSH.
- Setup guides and ready configurations for each assistant.
- **Architecture diagrams** of the agent, the terminal, the network and MCP,
  one click away on every screen.

### The agent

- **In the background of your Windows session**: close the browser and the
  apps and whatever it began goes on: runs, pulls, builds, transfers,
  backups, updates.
- **It keeps watch**: it brings containers back by their restart policy when
  it starts and when a session starts, and watches the host and the
  containers for the alarms and notifications below.
- **It serves everything**: the web interface, the Windows and Android
  clients, the REST API `/api/v1` and the MCP server `/api/v1/mcp`, all on
  one address and port (`127.0.0.1:8069` unless you choose another).
- **Per user, no administrator rights**: installed for your user alone, as
  `wslc` works inside a user session; its icon beside the clock opens its own
  page, with the System card over its log.
- **Updates itself** from a folder you choose (see [Updates](#updates)).

## Easy container management with WSLC

Everything `wslc` does, without typing it: lists that refresh themselves,
forms that check what you typed before it runs, and every action one click
away, in a table or as cards.

### Containers

- **List** with state, image, ports, CPU, memory, disk, id and restart
  policy; totals of CPU and memory; search; show only running ones; select
  several to start, stop or remove.
- **Run and create** from one form: image, name, ports, volumes and bind
  mounts, environment, networks with static addresses, entrypoint, command,
  working folder, user, restart policy, memory and CPU limits, health check.
  - **Paste a command**: a `docker run` or `wslc run` line, even across
    several lines, fills the form; flags it cannot use are named.
  - **Checked before it runs**: names in use, ports taken, missing networks,
    a command that listens on another port than the one published. Errors
    show on their fields.
  - **Load and export JSON**: an inspect output or a request exported from
    another agent.
  - Runs are jobs of the agent: progress in the list, a live console, cancel;
    a failed run keeps its settings to edit and try again.
- **View and edit** an existing container: saving recreates it with the new
  settings, rehearsed first under another name; if anything fails, the old one
  is restored.
- **Actions**: start, stop, restart, kill, remove; logs; live stats; files;
  a shell; copy the run command; export JSON; back up.
- **Details page**: logs, the editable form, the raw inspect JSON, bind
  mounts, a shell, files and live stats, one tab each, with Back through them.
- **Live stats**: CPU, memory, disk and network charts, sampled every 1.5 s.
- **Restart policies** (no, unless stopped, always) kept by the agent, which
  brings containers back when it starts and when a session starts.
- **Backup**: a stopped container exported to an archive and downloaded.

### Images

- **List** with usage, name, tag, id, date and size; disk usage; search;
  remove several at once.
- **Pull** (with its progress, a live console and cancel), **push**, **tag**,
  **save** to an archive, **import** and **load** archives.
- **Build** from a context folder: Dockerfile, tag, build arguments, labels,
  target stage, no cache, pull newer bases; live output and cancel.
- **Files of an image**, browsed through a temporary container.
- Which containers use an image; run or create a container from it.
- **Prune** dangling images; Docker Hub one click away to find images.

### Volumes

- **List**, search, remove several at once.
- **Create** on the guest or as a virtual disk (VHD) with a size, fixed or
  growing; options and labels.
- **Files of a volume**, browsed through a temporary container.
- Which containers use a volume; read and written traffic; **prune**.

### Networks

- **List** with driver, subnet, gateway, scope; search; remove several.
- **Create** with subnet, gateway, address range, internal, options, labels.
- **Edit**: saving replaces the network and reconnects its containers.
- **Connect and disconnect** containers, with a static address.
- **Network map**: networks as hubs, containers as nodes with their
  addresses, filtered by network or by container.
- Received and sent traffic; **prune**.

### Sessions and system

- **Session** selector in the title bar, with start and stop; screens that
  need a running session grey out while it is stopped, and a session stopped
  from the agent stays stopped.
- **System page**: `wslc`, Windows and kernel versions, runtime details, the
  virtual disks (VHDX) of every session and their sizes, the largest images.
- **Clean up**: prune images, volumes and networks; **compact** a session's
  virtual disk, with its size before and after.
- **Registries**: log in to and out of container registries.

## Manage from anywhere

From a phone, another PC or across the internet: not only the WSLC machine,
but its containers too, their consoles and their web pages, and the way the
world reaches them.

### Reach the agent

- **Trusted at the machine, login from anywhere else**: a user name and
  password for the internet, or an API token for scripts and assistants.
- **Every client, from any network**: the browser, the Windows app and the
  Android app, on the same machine, on the local network or across the
  internet.
- **Reverse SSH tunnels to a VPS**, kept alive across reboots by a script,
  for reaching the agent and its published containers from the internet with
  no port opened at home ([remote-access guide](developer/remote-access.md)).
- A request that came through a proxy is never taken as local.
- Passwords stored hashed; saved logins encrypted.

### Consoles

- **Host terminal** in the browser, also in a tab of its own; copy, clear,
  reconnect. At the agent's machine, Windows Terminal opens natively.
- **A shell in any container**, in a dialog or on its details page, or as a
  native terminal window at the agent's machine.
- A session and its output survive leaving the page.

### Open the containers' pages

- **Open a container's web page from anywhere**, even when it is not
  published: a browser runs on the agent's machine and its picture is
  streamed to you, with mouse, keyboard, touch, clipboard, back, forward and
  zoom, behind the agent's own login.
- **Sessions** can be joined by other viewers, or left running.
- **Saved logins**, shared by every client and encrypted on the agent, typed
  into the page on request.

### Publish containers

- **Publish a container's port** on a public HTTPS name from its form: the
  agent writes the map of a built-in nginx proxy container and restarts it.
- **Set up** creates the network and the proxy in one step; publications are
  listed, opened and removed from Settings.
- Every port offers its **local** address and, when published, its
  **remote** one.

## Files and transfers

- **Browse** a container's files: breadcrumbs, sizes, permissions, dates,
  links; select several; copy, cut and paste; rename; new folder; delete.
- **Edit text files** in place.
- **Upload** several files and **download** them; the native apps use the
  system's own Save and Open dialogs.
- **Transfers belong to the agent**: they keep running when the view closes,
  show on the container's row, can be cancelled, and every client sees them.
- Read-only mounts are marked, and what would fail there is greyed out.

## Logs and activity

- **Agent log**: time, level, source and message, with details that expand;
  filters by level and by type; copy or delete entries; follows new entries
  and holds still while you read.
- **CLI activity**: every `wslc` command the agent ran, the running ones
  included, with its time, exit code, command line and output.
- **Container logs**: coloured by level, searchable, live.
- The two share one page, with a divider you can move.

## Dashboard

The Home page is a dashboard designed by each user, not a fixed screen.

- **Pages**: *System* shows the machine, *User* what the user runs. The one
  looked at last opens again.
- **Views**: a landscape and a portrait layout, each designed on its own.
  Outside design the window's shape picks the view, and picks again when the
  window is resized or a phone is turned.
- **Where it is kept**: with the user on the agent, so every client opens the
  same dashboard, or on the device alone. Either can be copied onto the other.
- **Design mode**: a toolbox of every object and ready-made card, dragged onto
  a grid; objects never overlap. Select several with a marquee, group them
  into a card (Ctrl+G), undo (Ctrl+Z), delete. A floating properties window
  sets each object's source, size, type size, colours, elevation, alignment,
  margins, the parts it shows and how it widens on a wider screen.
- **Drafts**: every change is kept on the device until Save; a lost
  connection or a power cut loses nothing. Leaving with unsaved changes asks
  first.
- **Objects**: host CPU, memory and disk readings and dials; counts of
  containers, images, volumes and networks; CPU, memory, disk and network
  charts of the host or of any container, with legends; container, image,
  volume and network headers, details, dials, shortcuts and action buttons;
  the session selector; agent, client, `wslc`, Windows and kernel versions;
  the live events status; the agent's log; file transfers; free text.
- **Ready-made cards**: container, image, volume, network, system, charts.
- **Alarms**: each measure has a threshold; past it the object turns red and
  blinks. Chosen alarms also show as rings in a status bar on every screen.
- **Zoom and fit**: zoom in and out, and fit the view to any screen: Fit, Fill,
  Width, Stretch or Fluid. Each page and view keeps its own on each device;
  portrait opens Fluid and landscape Fill until you choose.
- **Charts**: any chart opens full size, with zoom.
- Out of design, tapping a card offers its actions (Run, Pull, Create…) and
  opens its page.

## Notifications

- **Watched by the agent itself**, whether or not a client is open: host
  disk, memory and CPU, and each container's memory and CPU, past a threshold
  for a number of minutes, and back under it; a container stopping
  unexpectedly or not restarting; a session going down; jobs finished or
  failed; the agent's own updates.
- **Delivered** as Windows notifications by the tray and the Windows app, and
  as push notifications on Android, with a Cancel button on an update's.
- Tapping one opens its page; the history is kept.

## Clients

- **One interface everywhere**: the web UI served by the agent (installable
  as an app), the **Windows** app and the **Android** app host the same
  screens.
- **One client, several agents**: this machine, others on the network or on
  the internet, each remembered with its login.
- **Self-updating clients**: a newer version is offered as soon as the agent
  has it; the web UI offers the right app to download.
- **Android**: the back gesture navigates the app; files saved through the
  system; push notifications.
- **Tray icon** on the agent's machine: the agent's page in its own window,
  its notifications, and the dashboard one click away.
- **Multi-client**: every client of an agent sees the same jobs (runs,
  pulls, transfers, updates) and can follow or cancel them; what belongs to
  a device (theme, zoom, views) stays on that device.

## Updates

- **The agent updates itself** from its package folder: with Auto update on,
  a newer installer is announced a minute ahead on every client and device,
  any of which can cancel it; it waits for transfers and backups, and the
  previous agent comes back if the installer fails. **Update now** otherwise.
- **The clients update from the same folder.**
- The package folder is asked by the installer and can be changed in
  Settings ([updating](updating.md)).

## Installation

- **Per-user installers** for the agent and the Windows client: no
  administrator rights. The agent's asks for its address, port and package
  folder, and starts at every logon.
- **Android** app as a signed APK.
- **Uninstalling** the Windows app asks whether to keep its preferences.
- **Build it yourself** with one script per installer; check the machine and
  the private files first; publish a release with one command
  ([getting started](developer/getting-started.md),
  [releasing](developer/releasing.md)).

## Personalisation

- Dark and light themes; page zoom; table or cards for every list, remembered
  per list and per device.
- **The look of every control**, tried live and saved per device: type, table
  rows, buttons, fields, tabs, cards; exported and imported as JSON.
- Lists: sort, resize and reorder columns, search, pages of 50, selections
  that survive refreshes, and refreshes driven by what changed.
- **Back is navigation** everywhere: tabs, searches, views and pages live in
  the address.
