.SYNOPSIS
    Publish a release: raise the release version above every build so far,
    build the three installers at it, and commit, tag and push it.
.DESCRIPTION
    The version in the repository is the last release's (Directory.Build.props
    for the agent, the client's csproj for the client and its Android
    versionCode); everyday builds raise only this checkout's own, in
    private\version.props. A release raises the repository's above both:

      1. Stops when the working tree has uncommitted changes.
      2. Writes the new versions: the agent's and the client's next patch
         above the higher of the release's and private\version.props, or
         -Version for both; the versionCode one above the higher of the two.
      3. Builds the agent installer (-Release: it offers
         C:\Berpiztu\wslc-ai-agent as the package folder), the Windows client
         installer and the APK, all with -NoBump, so they carry exactly the
         release's version.
      4. Only when all three built: commits the two files, tags v<agent
         version> and pushes both. When a build fails, the two files are put
         back and nothing is committed.
      5. With -Publish, creates the GitHub release with gh and uploads the
         three installers; without it, says which files to upload.

    The APK is signed with private\android.keystore (see
    docs\developer\private-files.md): a release signed with another key cannot
    update the installed app.
.PARAMETER Version
    The release's version for the agent and the client, x.y.z; it has to be
    above the agent's and the client's current ones.
.PARAMETER Publish
    Also create the GitHub release (gh must be signed in) and upload the
    installers to it.
