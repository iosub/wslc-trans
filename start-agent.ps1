.SYNOPSIS
    Build and start WSLC AI Agent for local development.
.DESCRIPTION
    Builds the solution (unless -NoBuild), frees the port if you agree, then
    runs WslcAgent.Server in the Development environment, which serves the
    Blazor UI from the build output, on http://127.0.0.1:8070 by default.
    -Watch runs it under dotnet watch instead (Hot Reload on save; it restarts
    the agent by itself when a change needs it, so the console is noisier).
    The agent's icon beside the clock starts too, pointed at this agent, so
    its notifications are tried without installing; it is closed, by its
    PID, when the agent stops (-NoTray leaves it out). The installed agent's
    icon, if running, stays.
    Works from any current directory: it always runs from the repository root.
.EXAMPLE
    .\start-agent.ps1
.EXAMPLE
    .\start-agent.ps1 -Port 5200
.EXAMPLE
    .\start-agent.ps1 -Watch      # dotnet watch: hot reload on save
.EXAMPLE
    .\start-agent.ps1 -NoTray     # the agent alone, without its icon beside the clock
