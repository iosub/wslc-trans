/// 2026): every container, image, volume and network the agent has seen,
/// each with a number of its own — its uid — that no rename and no recreate
/// changes, kept in <c>resources.json</c> in the agent's data folder. What the
/// resource is called and which WSLC id it has now are read from here; the
/// dashboard keeps only the uid, so a card stays on its resource through both. A resource that is removed takes its
/// uid with it, and a card that pointed at it is not drawn any more.
///
/// It is kept current two ways. The agent's own verbs say what they did: a
/// removal drops the entry at once, a recreate keeps its entry through the
/// moment the container does not exist and then gives it the new id and, if
/// it changed, the new name. Whatever changes behind the agent's back — the
/// CLI, by hand — is found on every full read of the list: an id it knows
/// takes the name it has now; an id it does not know, with the name of one
/// that is gone, is that one recreated; anything else is new; and what is no
/// longer there is dropped. The entries carry their kind, and the WSLC session
/// they live in: the agent can be switched to another session, whose resources are
/// others, and a read there must not take this session's uids away.
