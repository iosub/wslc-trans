/// <list type="number">
/// <item>
/// The client can show an elicitation prompt (Hermes draws it as its yes/no
/// approval box, Claude Code as a form). The tool asks through it and runs only
/// when the user picks yes. The model is not in the loop: nothing it passes can
/// stand in for that answer, so <c>confirm</c> is ignored. This needs a session
/// with a back channel, which is why the endpoint runs a stateful transport.
/// </item>
/// <item>
/// No elicitation (an older client, or one that refused the prompt): the
/// two-call token. Called without <c>confirm</c> the tool changes nothing — it
/// describes the target and answers a one-time <c>confirmToken</c>. The model
/// has to show that to the user, ask, and call again with the token.
/// </item>
/// </list>
/// The one thing the server can see is time. A model that chains both calls in
/// a single turn presents the token seconds after it was issued, faster than a
/// person could read the target and answer; a token younger than
/// <see cref="MinimumAge"/> is refused, and the refusal restarts its clock, so
/// retrying in a loop never converges — only a real pause does.
